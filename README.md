QZX Windows Workspace

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that sets up a temporary Windows RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) session using the Playit tunneling service. It is designed for development, testing, and remote access purposes.

📆 Workflow File

.github/workflows/qzx.yml


🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Fork or clone this repository.


2. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets

🔐 Login Credentials

Username: runneradmin

Password: p@ssw0rd!


🌐 RDP Address

Once the workflow is running, GitHub Actions will display the RDP address generated by Playit in the logs section.

Look for output like this:

TUNNELS
example-rdp-region.playit.gg:12345 => 127.0.0.1:3389 (proto: Tcp, port count: 1)
playit (v0.15.26): [tunnel ID] tunnel running, 1 tunnels registered

In this example, the RDP address is:

example-rdp-region.playit.gg:12345

Use this address in any Remote Desktop client to connect.

⚙️ Required Playit Tunnel Configuration

Make sure to configure your tunnel correctly in the Playit.gg dashboard:

Type: TCP

Forward To: 127.0.0.1:3389

Use a random public port, or set a fixed one if needed


This is required for RDP to connect properly to the GitHub-hosted Windows machine.

🥒 Session Duration

The session will stay alive for 6 hours (Start-Sleep -Seconds 21600).
